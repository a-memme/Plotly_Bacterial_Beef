*Note - had troubles reversing the y-axis to display in descending order - tried a number of different code variations with no luck. Below I've attached what was happening when altering my code with the .reverse() function: i.e line 92: otuIdsString = otuSorted.map(otuId => "OTU" + otuId).reverse(). Y labels reversed, however their corresponding x values remained the same.*
